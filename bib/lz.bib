For any given system, however, it may be the case that only a subset of its functionality is safety-critical and hence subject to certification; the rest of the functionality is non-safety-critical and does not need to be certified, or is certified to lower levels of assurance. The certification-cognizant runtime scheduling of such mixed-criticality systems is considered. An algorithm called EDF-VD (for Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines) is presented: this algorithm can schedule systems for which any number of criticality levels are defined. Efficient implementations of EDF-VD, as well as associated schedulability tests for determining whether a task system can be correctly scheduled using EDF-VD, are presented. For up to 13 criticality levels, analyses of EDF-VD, based on metrics such as processor speedup factor and utilization bounds, are derived, and conditions under which EDF-VD is optimal with respect to these metrics are identified. Finally, two extensions of EDF-VD are discussed that enhance its applicability. The extensions are aimed at scheduling a wider range of task sets, while preserving the favorable worst-case resource usage guarantees of the basic algorithm.}, journal = {J.

Previous solutions are limited in terms of deployment costs, identification accuracy, or usability. We propose SenseTribute, a novel occupant identification solution that makes use of existing and prevalent on-object sensors that are originally designed to monitor the status of objects to which they are attached. SenseTribute extracts richer information content from such on-object sensors and analyzes the data to accurately identify the person interacting with the objects. This approach is based on the physical phenomenon that different occupants interact with objects in different ways. Moreover, SenseTribute may not rely on users? true identities, so the approach works even without labeled training data. However, resolution of information from a single on-object sensor may not be sufficient to differentiate occupants, which may lead to errors in identification. To overcome this problem, SenseTribute operates over a sequence of events within a user activity, leveraging recent work on activity segmentation. We evaluate SenseTribute using real-world experiments by deploying sensors on five distinct objects in a kitchen and inviting participants to interact with the objects. We demonstrate that SenseTribute can correctly identify occupants in 96\% of trials without labeled training data, while per-sensor identification yields only 74\% accuracy even with training data.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

ABSTRACT = {Falls and fall-related injuries are major incidents, especially for elderly people, which often mark the onset of major deterioration of health. More than one-third of  home-dwelling people aged 65 or above and two-thirds of those in residential care fall once or more each year. Reliable fall detection, as well as prevention, is an important research topic for monitoring elderly living alone in residential or hospital units. The aim of this study is to review the existing fall detection systems and some of the key research challenges faced by the research community in this field. We categorize the existing platforms into two groups: wearable and ambient devices; the classification methods are divided into rule-based and machine learning techniques. The relative merit and potential drawbacks are discussed, and we also outline some of the outstanding research challenges that emerging new platforms need to address.},

In session-based interpretations of linear logic the analogue notion corresponds to determining which processes are composed, or cut, using compatible channels typed by linear propositions. In this work, we show that well-formed interactions represented in a session-based interpretation of classical linear logic (CLL) form strictly less-expressive interconnection networks than those of a multiparty session calculus. To achieve this result, we introduce a new compositional synthesis property dubbed partial multiparty compatibility (PMC), enabling us to build a global type denoting the interactions obtained by iterated composition of well-typed CLL threads. We then show that CLL composition induces PMC global types without circular interconnections between three (or more) participants. PMC is then used to define a new CLL composition rule that can form circular interconnections but preserves the deadlock-freedom of CLL.}, journal = {ACM Trans. Program. Lang.

This enables safe MPST-based programming of the parameterised endpoints in distributed settings: each endpoint can be implemented separately by different programmers, using different techniques (or languages). We prove the decidability of role variant inference and well-formedness checking, and the correctness of projection.

The APIs ensure a well-typed Go endpoint program (by native Go type checking) will perform only compliant I/O actions w.r.t. the source protocol. We leverage the abstractions of MPST to support the specification and implementation of Go applications involving multiple channels, possibly over mixed transports (e.g., Go channels, TCP), and channel passing via a unified programming interface.

Understanding the run-time performance of concurrent and distributed systems is of great importance for the identification of bottlenecks and optimisation opportunities. In the message-passing setting, these bottlenecks are generally communication overheads and synchronisation times. Despite its importance, reasoning about these intensional properties of software, such as performance, has received little attention, compared to verifying extensional properties, such as correctness. Behavioural protocol specifications based on sessions types capture not only extensional, but also intensional properties of concurrent and distributed systems. CAMP augments MPST with annotations of communication latency and local computation cost, defined as estimated execution times, that we use to extract cost equations from protocol descriptions. CAMP is also extendable to analyse asynchronous communication optimisation built on a recent advance of session type theories. We apply our tool to different existing benchmarks and use cases in the literature with a wide range of communication protocols, implemented in C, MPI-C, Scala, Go, and OCaml.

Our type system with universal types for polling can handle this dynamism and retain type safety.

We introduce refined multiparty session types (RMPST), an extension of MPST, that express data dependent protocols via refinement types on the data types. We provide an implementation of RMPST, in a toolchain called Session*, using Scribble, a toolchain for multiparty protocols, and targeting F*, a verification-oriented functional programming language. Users can describe a protocol in Scribble and implement the endpoints in F* using refinement-typed APIs generated from the protocol. The F* compiler can then statically verify the refinements.

Typically, the interactions in web-based distributed systems are informally described, making it hard to ensure correctness, especially communication safety, i.e. all endpoints progress without type errors or deadlocks, conforming to a specified protocol. We present STScript, a toolchain that generates TypeScript APIs for communication-safe web development over WebSockets, and RouST, a new session type theory that supports multiparty communications with routing mechanisms. STScript provides developers with TypeScript APIs generated from a communication protocol specification based on RouST. The generated APIs build upon TypeScript concurrency practices, complement the event-driven style of programming in full-stack web development, and are compatible with the Node.js runtime for server-side endpoints and the React.js framework for browser-side endpoints. RouST can express multiparty interactions routed via an intermediate participant. It supports peer-to-peer communication between browser-side endpoints by routing communication via the server in a way that avoids excessive serialisation. RouST guarantees communication safety for endpoint web applications written using STScript APIs. We evaluate the expressiveness of STScript for modern web programming using several production-ready case studies deployed as web applications.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Compiler Construction}, pages = {94?106}, numpages = {13}, keywords = {WebSocket, session types, API generation, TypeScript, deadlock freedom, web programming}, location = {Virtual, Republic of Korea}, series = {CC 2021} }

In this paper, we propose a new, generalised MPST theory. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We demonstrate that a revision of the theoretical foundations of MPST is necessary: classic MPST have a limited subject reduction property, with inherent restrictions that are easily overlooked, and in previous work have led to flawed type safety proofs; our new theory removes such restrictions and fixes such flaws. (2) We contribute a new MPST theory that is less complicated, and yet more general, than the classic one: it does not require global multiparty session types nor binary session type duality ? instead, it is grounded on general behavioural type-level properties, and proves type safety of many more protocols and processes. (3) We produce a detailed analysis of type-level properties, showing how, in our new theory, they allow to ensure decidability of type checking, and statically guarantee that processes enjoy, , deadlock-freedom and liveness at run-time. (4) We show how our new theory can integrate type and model checking: type-level properties can be expressed in modal µ-calculus, and verified with well-established tools. }, journal = {Proc.

abstract = {This paper advocates a strict compositional and hybrid approach for obtaining key (performance) metrics of embedded systems. At its core the developed methodology abstracts system components by either flow-oriented and purely analytic descriptions or by state-based models in the form of timed automata. The interaction among the heterogeneous components is modeled by streams of discrete activity-triggers. In total this yields a hybrid framework for the compositional analysis of embedded systems. It supplements contemporary techniques for the following reasons: (a) state space explosion as intrinsic to formal verification is limited to the level of isolated components; (b) computed performance metrics such as buffer sizes, delays and utilization rates are not overly pessimistic, because coarse-grained purely analytic models are used for components only which conform to the stateless model of computation. For demonstrating the usefulness of the presented ideas we implemented a corresponding tool-chain and investigated the performance of a two-staged computing system, where one stage exhibits state-dependent behavior only coarsely coverable by a purely analytic and stateless component abstraction.},

To model real-time implementations, we introduce a simple calculus with delays and a decidable static proof system. The proof system ensures type safety and time-error freedom, namely processes respect the prescribed timing and causalities between interactions. A decidable condition on timed global types guarantees time-progress for validated processes with delays, and gives a sound and complete characterisation of a new class of CTAs with general topologies that enjoys progress and liveness.",
