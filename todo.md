# TODO

Things to do in the short and long term.

## Short Term (1 month)

 - Collect the photos that Alex has taken, polish and distribute them to Lars and Deepak (Daniel,
   Andrew, Alex)

 - Typeset and polish examples (Daniel, Andrew, Alex)

 - Copy over the rules of MTT (Daniel)

 - Copy over the extensions we wish to add to MTT at some point (Daniel)

 - Send email to everyone with results of this interaction

 - Copy over the rules of higher order choreographies, along with references (Andrew)

 - Copy over the translation into pi calculus (Andrew)

## Medium Term (< 3 months)

 - Define a translation from _simply_ typed MTT into higher order choreographies

 - Define a back-translation into simply typed MTT

 - Collect examples from literature to try in _dependent_ MTT

 - Explore new examples in dependent MTT, noting when the dependence is necessary!

 - What do "normal" modalities mean when we interpret them as server? What does irrelevance mean if
   we pretend that we're talking about a server? How about S4 box? etc

## Long Term (6 months)

 - Decide what constitutes the first paper, how much of this do we want and need to include?

 - If we submit a POPL paper, to what extent do we depend on Andrew's other submission?

 - Like, write a paper

## Pie in the sky

 - Extensions to MTT!

 - Implementation of MTT which we can use to run & compute on distributed systems
