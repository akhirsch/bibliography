\label{sec:man}

The work plan for this project is given in Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} in a
quarterly breakdown based on the research goals listed in
section~\ref{sec:research}.   The PIs plan to work closely together across all tasks. The
research  will proceed largely in the order in which our specific goals were presented in Thrust 1 and Thrust 2.  Thrust 3 will proceed in parallel to these efforts
and integrate the contributions as the theory is developed.  The PIs plan to work together and have their students collaborate on all thrusts.
