\section{The \langnameraw~ Language}
\label{sec:language}
We now introduce \langname: a polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus for choreographies which allows for the communication of dynamically generated location names and types.
This calculus extends the Pirouette~\cite{HirschG22} language and inherits the core of its syntax, type-system, and semantics.
Moreover, we retain the guarantee of deadlock freedom and other simple static properties, while significantly extending the set of well-typed programs.
